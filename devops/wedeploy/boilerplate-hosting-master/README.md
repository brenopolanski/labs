# WeDeploy Hosting Boilerplate

This template will help you through the process of deploying a WeDeploy Hosting service.

> [Visit the documentation to learn how to start hosting static files.](https://wedeploy.com/docs/hosting/)

## How it works

Any files you drop into the hosting container are served as static files.

Files put into the special directory `/_error` are mapped as the error files to be served in case of an error. They must take the form of `<error code>.html`.
